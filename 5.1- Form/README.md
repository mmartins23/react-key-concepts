This code is a React functional component called `App` that renders a simple form for inputting an email address and displays a message if the entered email is invalid.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The component imports the necessary functions from React and sets up two pieces of state using the `useState` hook:

   - `enteredEmail`: This state variable holds the value entered into the email input field.
   - `inputIsInvalid`: This state variable is initially set to `false` and will be used to determine if the entered email is invalid.

2. There are two event handler functions defined within the component:

   - `emailChangeHandler`: This function is called when the user types in the email input field. It updates the `enteredEmail` state with the current input value.

   - `submitFormHandler`: This function is called when the user submits the form. It first prevents the default form submission behavior (which would reload the page). Then, it checks whether the entered email contains the '@' character, and if it doesn't, it sets `inputIsInvalid` to `true`.

3. The `return` statement defines the JSX structure to render:

   - It includes a `<form>` element with an input field for entering an email address.
   - The `onChange` attribute of the input field is set to the `emailChangeHandler` function, which updates the `enteredEmail` state as the user types.
   - The `onSubmit` attribute of the form is set to the `submitFormHandler` function, which handles form submission.
   - If `inputIsInvalid` is `true`, it displays a message indicating that an invalid email address has been entered.

The component creates a simple form for email input and provides basic validation by checking for the presence of the '@' character in the email. If the email is invalid, it displays an error message.
